You have successfully used Python and SQL to load data from multiple sources, process it, and begin to perform an analysis. It's now up to you to further explore the data, create new features, and estimate the probability that a judo athlete will earn a medal.\n\nNot sure where to go from here? Here are a few potential next steps:\n- Some countries lack country data because they have different names in the `olympics_data` and the `countries_data` (e.g., \"Great Britain\" and \"United Kingdom\"). Can you resolve these discrepancies?\n- How do athlete statistics, such as height and weight, relate to judo performance?\n- What type of model(s) will you use to predict whether an athlete wins a medal? Consider checking out [Machine Learning with scikit-learn](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn) if you want a refresher on machine learning in Python!\n\nWhen you're finished, be sure to share your analysis. Click the **Share** button to build a sleek publication that includes the rendered  text, code cells, and code output. When you publish your work, it appears automatically on your DataCamp profile so you can build out your portfolio.
